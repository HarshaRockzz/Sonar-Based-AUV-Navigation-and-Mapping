## Abstract
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a critical role in underwater operations such as exploring shipwrecks, monitoring offshore structures, and performing construction stability analysis. This project advances existing systems by focusing on:

- Developing robust object detection and avoidance mechanisms.
- Implementing a dead reckoning algorithm for navigation in GPS-deprived areas.
- Designing an intuitive GUI for mission planning and real-time monitoring.

## Key Features

### 1. **Object Detection and Avoidance**
- Trained object detection models using **YOLOv5**, **YOLOv8**, and **Mobilenet**.
- Calculated object dimensions, distances, and bearings using **OpenCV**.
- Implemented object avoidance algorithms integrated with thruster control.

### 2. **Dead Reckoning Navigation**
- Estimated AUV coordinates using sensor data from:
  - **Inertial Navigation Systems (INS):** Yaw, Pitch, Roll.
  - **Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL):** Velocity.
- Applied corrections for bias, scale-factor errors, and random walk to minimize errors.

### 3. **Mission Planning GUI**
- Developed with **PyQt5**, enabling:
  - Real-time trajectory visualization.
  - Waypoint-based navigation.
  - Critical decision-making based on sensor monitoring.

### 4. **Integrated System**
- Communication between **Jetson Nano** (object detection) and **Raspberry Pi** (thruster control).
- Achieved real-time synchronization and performance optimization through multiprocessing.


## Methodology

### 1. **Object Detection and Avoidance**
- Collected datasets from underwater environments.
